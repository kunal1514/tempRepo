<a name="14517"></a><h2 class="newpage">Deciding on the content of the report</h2><p><a name="14518"></a>Before you do anything else, you should outline the information you want the report to provide. The following questions can act as a guide in making that outline.</p><a name="293126"></a><h3>Stating the purpose</h3>
<a name="293127"></a><h4>What is the overall purpose of the report?</h4><p><a name="293128"></a>Reports are management tools. Their purpose is to help you quickly grasp the essential elements and relationships found in raw data, to help you make effective decisions. For a report to be effective, it has to present the correct data in a logical way. If it presents the wrong data, or if it presents the right data in a haphazard manner, the report may slow the decision<nobr>-m</nobr>aking process or may even encourage incorrect decisions.</p><p><a name="14543"></a>A good starting place in the development of a report is to write out the purpose of the report in a sentence or two. The purpose statement helps you focus on your primary needs, and it gives the report both a starting point and a goal. Here are some examples of purpose statements.</p><ul type="disc"><a name="14544"></a><li>The purpose of this report is to show monthly and year<nobr>-t</nobr>o<nobr>-d</nobr>ate sales by sales representatives, compare this year's numbers to last year's, and flag representatives whose sales figures do not meet company standards.
<a name="14545"></a><li>The purpose of this report is to show sales activity for each item in inventory, and to suggest reorder quantities based on that activity.
<a name="14546"></a><li>The purpose of this report is to calculate bowling averages and handicaps for each member of the bowling league.
</ul><p><a name="14547"></a>Defining the purpose of the report before you start is a critical step in the overall process.</p><a name="291135"></a><h4>Who is going to read the report?</h4><p><a name="14551"></a>A single report is often used by many individuals. A detailed, company<nobr>-w</nobr>ide sales report, for example, may be used by sales representatives, the regional sales manager, the national sales manager, and the Chief Operating Officer (COO).</p><p><a name="14552"></a>These individuals will be interested in different aspects of the report:</p><ul type="disc"><a name="14553"></a><li>A sales representative will use the report to evaluate individual sales performance and compare this performance to that of other representatives in the region.
<a name="14554"></a><li>The regional sales manager will use the report to evaluate regional representatives and compare the region's performance to that of other regions.
<a name="14555"></a><li>The national sales manager will use the report to evaluate the performance of regional managers and compare overall sales to the current sales forecasts.
<a name="14556"></a><li>The COO will use the report to evaluate the performance of the Vice<nobr>-P</nobr>resident of Marketing and the sales department as a whole, and to project such things as manufacturing needs and warehouse locations.
</ul><p><a name="155718"></a>Since each user of the report has different interests, it is important to plan the report so it includes the information each user is looking for.</p>
