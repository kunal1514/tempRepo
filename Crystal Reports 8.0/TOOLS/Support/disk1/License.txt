SEAGATE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
1.	GRANT OF LICENSE:  Seagate Software, Inc. ("Seagate") grants to you, the end 
user, a personal, nonexclusive license to use a single copy of the NetManage SupportNow 
software program, including any updates and documentation provided by Seagate in 
connection therewith (the "Software"), solely for your own internal use, and solely in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of this software license agreement ("Agreement").  
The Software is licensed, not sold, to you.  You acknowledge that the Software is designed to 
permit Seagate and its authorized contractors ("Support Providers") to access your computer 
systems, applications and files in order to facilitate the support and maintenance of certain 
Seagate software applications, including other third-party applications which you may be 
using in conjunction with such Seagate applications.  The Software permits you to control the 
access rights and privileges granted to these Support Providers and, therefore, to the extent 
you have granted access rights to a Support Provider, you grant such Support Provider the 
right to access and manipulate your computer systems, applications, files and associated data 
as reasonably necessary to provide you with support and maintenance.  This Agreement is a 
license to use the Software and does not entitle you to any support or telephone assistance 
from Seagate.  However, you may order support services pursuant to a separate agreement 
with Seagate.

2.	RESTRICTIONS:  Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, you hereby 
acknowledge and agree that:  (1) you will not modify or translate the Software, except that 
you may configure the Software using the menus, options and tools provided for such 
purposes and contained in the Software; (2) you will not copy the Software except as 
permitted in Section 3; (3) you will not in any way reverse engineer, disassemble or 
decompile the Software or any portion thereof except to the extent and for the express 
purposes authorized by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation; (4) you will not use the 
Software on a timesharing basis or to operate a service bureau facility for the benefit of third-
parties; (5) you will not transmit, or provide access to, the Software over a network except for 
operation of the Software as described in the associated documentation; (6) you will not use 
the Software other than in connection with the support of Seagate software applications by 
Support Providers; and (7) you will not sublicense, assign, rent, sell, lease, distribute or 
otherwise transfer the Software or any of the rights granted by this Agreement, except that 
you may physically transfer the Software from one computer to another computer under your 
control and you may transfer the Software (including all prior versions if the Software is an 
update) and accompanying written materials on a permanent basis to the successor or 
purchasing entity pursuant to a merger, corporate reorganization or sale of relevant assets, 
provided you retain no copies and the recipient agrees to the terms of this Agreement.  If you 
wish to develop and/or test an interface to the Software or merge the Software with any other 
software, you shall inform Seagate and Seagate, at its option, may provide you with 
information sufficient to enable interoperability between the Software and such other 
software or products. 

3.	COPYRIGHT:  The Software is copyrighted by Seagate and/or its suppliers and is 
protected by United States copyright and patent laws and international treaty provisions.  You 
may not copy the Software except to provide a backup copy and to load the Software into 
computers as part of executing the Software.  Solely with respect to documentation included 
with the Software, you may make a reasonable number of copies (either in hardcopy or 
electronic form), provided that such copies shall be used only in connection with your 
licensed use of the Software and are not republished or distributed to any third party.  You 
must reproduce and include all copyright notices, trademarks or other proprietary legends of 
Seagate and its suppliers on any copy of the Software or documentation made by you.  Any 
and all other copies of the Software and/or the documentation made by you are in violation of 
this Agreement.   

4.	OWNERSHIP AND CONFIDENTIALITY:  You agree that Seagate and/or its 
suppliers retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software and all copies at all times, 
regardless of the form or media in or on which the original or other copies may subsequently 
exist.  You agree that you neither own nor hereby acquire any claim or right of ownership to 
the Software or to any related patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property.  
You agree to use your best efforts to prevent and protect the contents of the Software from 
unauthorized disclosure or use.  Seagate and/or its suppliers reserve all rights not expressly 
granted to you.  Seagate's suppliers and Support Providers are the intended third party 
beneficiaries of this Agreement and have the express right to rely upon and directly enforce 
the terms set forth herein.  Seagate will use reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality 
of any non-public information and data which you may disclose, or which Seagate may 
observe, pursuant to Seagate's access to your computer systems during the conduct of its 
support activities; provided such information and data has been conspicuously marked as 
"confidential" or "proprietary".  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that the 
communications sessions utilized by the Software are implemented through the Internet, 
which is inherently insecure, and Seagate shall not be liable for any security breaches 
occurring on the Internet.  You should take the foregoing into account when granting the 
Support Providers any access privileges.  You further agree that you will not release the 
results of any performance or functional evaluation of the Software to any third party without 
the prior written approval of Seagate for each such release. 

5.	TERM AND TERMINATION:  This Agreement is effective until terminated.  You 
may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing Seagate with written notice, provided 
that you have complied with the destruction policies set forth below.  This Agreement will 
automatically terminate if you fail to comply with its terms and conditions.  You agree that, 
upon any termination, you will destroy all the materials delivered to you and certify to 
Seagate, in writing, that all copies and partial copies thereof have been completely destroyed 
and are no longer being used.  Sections 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 shall survive any expiration or 
termination of this Agreement.   

6.		DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES:  BECAUSE THE SOFTWARE IS 
PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE SOFTWARE.  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE 
AND ANY SERVICES PROVIDED UTILIZING THE SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS 
IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR 
GUARANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR 
OTHERWISE, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS:  (I) OF MERCHANTABILITY; (II) OF 
SATISFACTORY OR MERCHANTABLE QUALITY; (III) OF FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (IV) OF NONINFRINGEMENT; OR (V) ARISING FROM 
COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR USAGE OF TRADE.  
SEAGATE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE 
WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.  SOME 
STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU 
MAY HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR BY 
JURISDICTION.

7.		LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY:  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SEAGATE OR ITS DISTRIBUTORS, 
SUPPLIERS, SUPPORT PROVIDERS, OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR:  (I) COSTS 
OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; (II) SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF 
CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF SEAGATE OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; (III) ANY CLAIM AGAINST 
YOU BY ANY THIRD PARTY; AND (IV) ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES TO 
YOU, OR THOSE CLAIMING THROUGH YOU, IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR'S 
ANNUAL SUPPORT FEES PAID BY YOU TO SEAGATE.  THESE LIMITATIONS 
WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF 
ANY LIMITED REMEDY.  YOU AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS 
REASONABLE GIVEN THAT THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE.  
SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR 
EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, 
SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Furthermore, you acknowledge that you may configure the Software so as to permit the 
Support Providers to access your computer systems, files and associated data for support and 
maintenance purposes.  This access is merely to facilitate support on your behalf, and you 
remain solely responsible for backing up your systems, files and data.  The Support Providers 
shall not be liable to you, regardless of the cause of action, including the Support Providers' 
own negligence, for any loss of data or loss of use of your computer systems due to their 
support activities or their use of the Software.  If the Software proves defective, your 
exclusive remedy, and Seagate's sole responsibility, shall be to provide you with that level of 
support contracted by you with Seagate, but without utilizing the Software.  

8.	EXPORT CONTROLS:  None of the Software or underlying information or 
technology may be exported or re-exported into (or to a national or resident of) any country in 
violation of the export-control laws and administrative regulations of the United States, or any 
other applicable jurisdiction.  By using the Software, you are agreeing to the foregoing and 
you are representing and warranting that you are not located in, under the control of, or a 
national or resident of any such country.

9.	U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS:  The Software is a "commercial item," as that term 
is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and 
"commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 
(Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-
4 (June 1995) (or an equivalent provision, e.g., in supplements of various U.S. government 
agencies, as applicable), all U.S. Government users acquire the Software with only those

10.	GENERAL:  Except as otherwise preempted by United States federal law, this 
Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, United States, without reference 
to conflict of laws provisions or the United Nations 1980 Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods and any amendments thereto.  If any provision of this Agreement 
is ruled invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this 
Agreement.  This Agreement and the agreements referenced herein constitute the entire
